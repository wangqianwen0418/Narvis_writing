%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Visual designs can be complex in modern data visualization systems, which poses special challenges for explaining them to the general audience. However, there is few theoretical work or presentation tool tailored for introducing a data visualization design. In this study, we present Narvis, an authoring tool for the crafting of  narrative slideshows that introduces a visualization design. In Narvis, a visualization is specified as a combination of visual units and demonstrated in a constructing way. To better guide the crafting of an introduction slideshow, we incorporate lessons from previous work with our observation and propose a hierarchical constructing model, which consist of: conceptual components at different hierarchical levels, the process that components assemble another component at a higher level, and suggestions for the utility of narratives when introducing different components. Guided by this model, we implement a library of templates in Narvis. It enables the editors crafting an introduction slideshow through assembling these templates, thus achieves a level of expressiveness while improving efficiency. Narvis is designed and implemented specified for text visualizations but can be generalized to other types of visualizations. We evaluate Narvis through a preliminary evaluation of the authoring experience, a quantitative analysis of the generated slide show, and a qualitative analysis of the generated slideshow in the aspect of aesthetic, engagement, readability and utility.
